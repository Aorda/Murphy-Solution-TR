# Politecnico Programming Solutions

After solving countless problems with my friends while helping them study for programming exams, I've had enough solutions to publish as a full-on repository. Some have comments that are in Turkish, and most don't have any comments at all, so I suggest getting used to understanding the code by just looking at it.

If you have any questions, I don't care. Send an email to your professor. I doubt he will reply, though, as he was already too lazy to write up a solution himself.
